        <h2>Our Motivation and Mission</h2>
        <p>
          <em>"In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity." &mdash;Einstein</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Start Charlotte exists to provide the things you need to get on with
          your business.  Our goal: you do the things you're good at, we'll
          shoulder the rest.  We'll connect you with people
          and resources that make your life and work easier.  We'll help you
          automate the mundane, empowering you to spend more time exercising
          the talents your clients are interested in.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a new venture, we're still discovering all the ways we can be
          useful, but our vision remains this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>CREATIVE ENDEAVORS ARE WORTH NURTURING</em>
        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          In the wake of the 2009 recession, the city of Charlotte is in a state
          of transformation.  This seeming instability provides an opportunity for
          the growth of a broad freelance market; as businesses cut staff or
          initiate hiring freezes, work still has to be done, deadlines have to
          be met, projects still need to be completed.  Freelance developers,
          designers, artists, photographers, and writers complete these projects
          without additional headcount or impact on the human resources budgets
          of already straining corporate financials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often as belts tighten, the entrepreneurial spark rises within the freelance
          community and startup projects are the result. Making a company work requires
          quite a bit more than an idea and an implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But where is the support structure?  Freelance developers traditionally
          operate either on their own, or under the auspices of a consulting
          company.  Startup companies, with their increased responsibility are
          left to their own devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consulting companies rarely provide the increasingly necessary support
          services a freelancer requires, and they take a heavy cut of the
          bill rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soloists, even those operating within their own LLC or other company
          structure have to provide everything for themselves: billing, legal,
          health and life insurance, tax services.  If they work
          remotely, they also provide their own office space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The attributes that make a freelance consultant of any stripe worth
          engaging are their specialties. A graphic designer wants to be designing,
          not calculating their tax liability and worrying about which health
          insurance provider will serve their family.  A software developer
          isn't likely to be an expert at contract law, or writing an engagement
          agreement.  They should be able to focus on their talents and skills
          rather than suffer the distractions of running a business.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's where Start Charlotte comes in.
        </p>
        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <h3>The Community</h3>
        <p>
          One measure of that vision is to help support the existing community
          of freelancers, startup companies, and interested third parties by
          providing channels through which they can share information, leads,
          contacts, and opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are building an online connection portal to facilitate knowledge transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are providing event space for as many creative or technical groups that want to use
          our facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are partnering with individuals, companies, and
          groups that share our vision and enthusiasm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we'll be generating events of our own,
          intended as networking and teaching sessions to round out the
          expertise of the freelance community at large.
        </p>
        <h3>The Company</h3>
        <p>
          Another facet of our vision involves nurturing a collective company
          composed of like-minded individuals who want to share the wealth of
          their knowledge, experience, and support with each other.  Structuring
          our company as a collective with many non-managing members enables us
          to negotiate as a group to reduce overall individual expenses through
          affiliation:
        </p>
        <h4>Short Term</h4>
        <p>
          We've set up a coworking space for people who want to work in the presence
          of other creatives.  Desks, chairs, wifi.  We're looking for partners to
          help provide health insurance, life insurance, tax services, billing
          services, and legal services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we've vetted the services, we'll offer them to you, and you can
          become part of the Start Charlotte family -- not as a client, as a
          member.  As a collective, an affiliance, each individual contributes
          to the buying and negotiating power of the whole, but without sacrificing
          any of their own independence or creative spark.
        </p>
        <h4>Long Term</h4>
        <p>
          It is our hope that out of this collective, through working closely
          with the other residents of the coworking space and attendees of
          our events, companies will germinate.  We want to support and
          encourage these companies by providing advice, organizational services,
          and funding.  Creative endeavors are worth nurturing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're not looking for clients.  We're looking for partners -- people
          who want to do their own thing, but with a community of other
          like-minded people watching their back, helping them shoulder their
          load, and looking out for their businesses and their families.
        </p>
        <p>
          By supporting these creative endeavors, encouraging others to do
          the same, and supporting a community of entrepreneurs,
          Start Charlotte hopes to develop Charlotte, NC into a city
          that embraces the
          <em>startup culture</em>.
          Successful startups
          will raise the profile of the city and its residents, and other
          creative and enterprising individuals will be drawn here.
