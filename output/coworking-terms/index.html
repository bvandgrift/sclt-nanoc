        <h1>Coworking Terms and Member Agreement</h1>
        <h2>Membership</h2>
        <p>
          Start Charlotte coworking membership does not creates a
          tenancy, but a prepaid usage license to use the provided
          amenities on a monthly basis.  This license may be
          cancelled by either Start Charlotte or the licensee at
          any time.
        </p>
        <h2>Member Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          All members shall adhere to the rules of conduct
          at all times. Failure to do so will result in a stern
          talking-to, and possible revocation of coworking
          privileges.
        </p>
        <p>
          These rules can be summarized as follows:
          <i>Treat your fellow coworkers with respect</i>.
          If you need
          specifics, they follow:
        </p>
        <h3>Quiet Enjoyment</h3>
        <p>
          All members and guests have the right to quiet
          enjoyment and any behavior that breaches this will
          not be condoned.
        </p>
        <h3>Open Environment</h3>
        <p>
          Start Charlotte Coworking is an open space shared
          by many different people and organizations.  Don't say
          or do anything you're not comfortable with everyone
          seeing, or that may make your coworkers uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <h3>Internet / Network Usage</h3>
        <p>
          Be respectful of the bandwidth.  No spam, no illegal
          behavior. Start Charlotte will not monitor the network unless
          we have to.
        </p>
        <h3>No Pets or Bikes</h3>
        <p>
          No pets of any kind.  Bikes can be stored to the left
          of the main entrance on the bike rack.
        </p>
        <h2>Member Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          Leave your desk in better shape than you found it. Be
          nice to your fellow coworkers. Pay your bills.  That is all.
        </p>
        <h2>Not So Fine Print</h2>
        <p>
          Coworking membership, and the terms of that membership
          are subject to change pending 30 day notification of the
          membership.  This includes these terms, coworking rates,
          and facility policies.
        </p>
        <h3>Deposit</h3>
        <p>
          No deposit is required to license the Start Charlotte
          coworking facilities.
        </p>
        <h3>Payment</h3>
        <p>
          Payment is due for each month's license, in advance,
          based on the date and license rate you started with.
          An interruption of license will reset the license rate
          to the current rate.  Should the license rate ever
          decrease, all members will be reduced to the new rate
          on their next billing statement.
        </p>
        <h3>Keys</h3>
        <p>
          Some members may be issued keys to the facilities.  These
          keys remain the property of Start Charlotte, LLC, and must be
          returned before a membership is cancelled.  A bond may be
          assessed before keys are issued; if so, that bond will be
          remitted when the keys are returned.
        </p>
        <h3>Liability</h3>
        <p>
          As a member, you agree to hold Start Charlotte, LLC blameless
          for any injury or damage suffered by you or your equipment
          while on the premises.  Conversely, you are responsible for
          any damage done to the property of Start Charlotte, LLC, or any
          other member while present at the coworking facility.
        </p>
        <h3>Renewal and Termination</h3>
        <p>
          Renewal is a privilege, not a right.  All management
          decisions are final, and all payments are non-refundable.
        </p>
        <h3>Conflicts with Other Members</h3>
        <p>This isn't high school.  Work it out like adults.</p>
        <h2>Finally</h2>
        <p>
          This space is provided with the understanding that
          scheduled events, environmental effects, and decisions
          by the management of Area 15 may affect your ability
          to use the space.  There are no guarantees of any kind
          concerning available hours, resources, or facilities.
        </p>
        <p>We all do the best we can.  Enjoy.</p>
