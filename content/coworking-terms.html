      <h1>Coworking Terms and Member Agreement</h1>

      <h2>Membership</h2>

      <p>Start Charlotte coworking membership does not creates a 
      tenancy, but a prepaid usage license to use the provided
      amenities on a monthly basis.  This license may be 
      cancelled by either Start Charlotte or the licensee at
      any time.</p>

      <h2>Member Conduct</h2>

      <p>All members shall adhere to the rules of conduct
      at all times. Failure to do so will result in a stern
      talking-to, and possible revocation of coworking 
      privileges.</p>

      <p>These rules can be summarized as follows:
      <i>Treat your fellow coworkers with respect</i>.  If you need
      specifics, they follow:</p>

      <h3>Quiet Enjoyment</h3>

      <p>All members and guests have the right to quiet
      enjoyment and any behavior that breaches this will
      not be condoned.</p>

      <h3>Open Environment</h3>

      <p>Start Charlotte Coworking is an open space shared
      by many different people and organizations.  Don't say
      or do anything you're not comfortable with everyone
      seeing, or that may make your coworkers uncomfortable.</p>

      <h3>Internet / Network Usage</h3>

      <p>Be respectful of the bandwidth.  No spam, no illegal
      behavior. Start Charlotte will not monitor the network unless
      we have to.</p>

      <h3>No Pets or Bikes</h3>

      <p>No pets of any kind.  Bikes can be stored to the left
      of the main entrance on the bike rack.</p>

      <h2>Member Responsibilities</h2>

      <p>Leave your desk in better shape than you found it. Be
      nice to your fellow coworkers. Pay your bills.  That is all.</p>

      <h2>Not So Fine Print</h2>

      <p>Coworking membership, and the terms of that membership
      are subject to change pending 30 day notification of the 
      membership.  This includes these terms, coworking rates,
      and facility policies.</p>

      <h3>Deposit</h3>

      <p>No deposit is required to license the Start Charlotte
      coworking facilities.</p>

      <h3>Payment</h3>

      <p>Payment is due for each month's license, in advance,
      based on the date and license rate you started with.  
      An interruption of license will reset the license rate 
      to the current rate.  Should the license rate ever
      decrease, all members will be reduced to the new rate
      on their next billing statement.</p>

      <h3>Keys</h3>

      <p>Some members may be issued keys to the facilities.  These
      keys remain the property of Start Charlotte, LLC, and must be
      returned before a membership is cancelled.  A bond may be
      assessed before keys are issued; if so, that bond will be 
      remitted when the keys are returned.</p>

      <h3>Liability</h3>

      <p>As a member, you agree to hold Start Charlotte, LLC blameless
      for any injury or damage suffered by you or your equipment
      while on the premises.  Conversely, you are responsible for
      any damage done to the property of Start Charlotte, LLC, or any
      other member while present at the coworking facility.</p>

      <h3>Renewal and Termination</h3>

      <p>Renewal is a privilege, not a right.  All management
      decisions are final, and all payments are non-refundable.</p>

      <h3>Conflicts with Other Members</h3>

      <p>This isn't high school.  Work it out like adults.</p>

      <h2>Finally</h2>

      <p>This space is provided with the understanding that 
      scheduled events, environmental effects, and decisions
      by the management of Area 15 may affect your ability
      to use the space.  There are no guarantees of any kind
      concerning available hours, resources, or facilities.</p>
      <p>We all do the best we can.  Enjoy.</p>
