<h2>Start Charlotte Coworking</h2>

<p>We operate a coworking facility at Area Fifteen, at the corner of 15th St.
  and Caldwell St.  We have a few seats, wifi, and air conditioning, and tend
  to be open from 8a-5p Monday through Friday.</p>

<p>Anyone is welcome visit for a few days, but if you're putting down roots,
  we'd like some help with the rent.  The coworking space isn't intended to
  be a profitable venture, just a place where smart people can gather and
  help each other out.  That said, we still have to keep the lights on.</p>
